	<h2> Summary </h2>
	<p>Dana Evernden is a <i>learner</i></p>
	<p>I once took a strengths finder test at work, and learning was my number one strength, and I couldn't agree with that assessment more. I love getting myself into new situations and seeing how I survive and grow, and in turn learn more about myself and the world around me. </p>
	<p>
	</p>
	<p>I grew up in the small town of Holliston Massachusetts, a suburb about 45 minutes southwest of Boston. I went to UMass Amherst and acquired a degree in Industial Engineering. I've worked for EnerNOC, an energy efficiency company, from the day I left college. I love the people, work environment, and the passion and energy there. My responsibilities have changed quite a bit since I secured a full time position alomst two years ago, and these days I focus less on my teams' responsibilities and more on building Excel VBA tools for other teams within the Operations department.
	</p><p></p>
	In my spare time I have a myriad of weird hobbies. I enjoy playing the euphonium, dragon boating, drum corps. I also enjoy normal hobbies like drawing, cooking, rock climbing, running, and hanging out with my Little Sister from Big Sisters of Greater Boston. I like setting almost impossible goals and meeting them, and most of all, I like learning. I've tried out being a prep chef, shadowing in an elementary school classroom, backpacking through europe, taking an html class, and running a marathon in just the past 10 months. </p>
	<p> </p> I aspire to change the world one person at a time with some quotes from my favorite professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst - George N. Parks. He created this concept called "starred thoughts" and has been preaching his ideas ever since.  <a href "http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/starred-thought">Here</a> is a tumblr that a student made filled with his ideas: </p>

<!--in a terminal (for MAC) like prompt, write (change directory) - cd danaevernden.com to see the directory -->
<!--write ls in the same command prompt to see the directory -->
<!--can also cd through folders within the directory-->
<!--git add adds a file to github-->
<!--nav is the navigation command - an unordered list is within the nav -->
<!--git push origin master" tells you that you pushed to github-->
<!--git commit -m "here's the note i'm going to leave when adding a file"-->
<!--html stands for hyper text markup language-->
<!--all blocks of a webpage span 100% of the page-->
<!--div tage will divide up the webpage, people often put images within the div tag, it'll be positioned in your CSS code-->
<!--padding looks different in every browser-->
<!--mkdir creates a new directory (folder). ul followed by li for each line is unordered list (bullet points)-->
<!--html5 made these semantics to universalize webpages so everyone can understand a webpage structure-->
<!--scalable vector graphics svgs) are replacing pngs-->

<!--10/23/2014 notes-->
<!--style 3 different ways - style within each header, style within the <head> section with <style> and h2{font size: 48p}, or style via CSS sheet-->
<!--.css file will be the style sheet-->
<!--body{background color:white, rgb(233, 223, 214) or #000000;,etc}-->
<!-- style at the top with <link style = href="StyleSheet.css"-->
<!-- pading: 100px moves it away from the sides by 100px-->
<!--color applies to all of the text-->
<!-- how to provide a link at the bottom that says "Back to Top"-->
<!--10/30/2014
wrapper is a class
class you can have more than one of, ids are unique
classes are easily overwritten, ids are not
ids are for specific objects


CSS box model
- padding on the inside of the box takes the attributes of the textbox and adds space between the border and the text
- margin adds space between the element before (header) and the element after (text box) without taking attributes of either object

padding is used to add space around an object

margin is used for spacing between elements 

position
- relative/static/absolute/fixed - telling html where you want it on the page and how to behave in relevance to other objects on the page
- relative - element positioning is relative to itself, not going to be affected by anything else but it's own position
- static is the default position
- absolute - if a div1 is within div2, and the div2 is 10 pixels down, and div1 absolute and is told to move 5 pixels down, it will move 15 pixels down
- fixed - navigation bars that don't move at all when you scroll down
- website css-tricks.com

float
- like a news page with multiple pictures, some on the left and some on the right
- left - 
- right - 
- none - 

typekit
- allows fonts to be referenced via a link in the header so you don't have to download the files 

pseudo classes
-hover  - ordered lists like a navigation, ordered lists, etc
- 1st child, nth child, last chlid, etc - tell everything in a list except the last child to have the same spacing. you can also do this with the nth child
- active link - nav bar on the side, when scrolling down, the relavent links light up

operators
- rarely used

11/6::::
design for hackers - david kindary
don't make me think - steve krug
hex color theory
#ffffff = white
#000000 = black
#ff0000 = red
#00ff00 = green
#0000ff = blue

first two are red
second two are green
third two are blue

wireframes are skeletons of your design - the layout of everything minus the content
UX teams use this to problem solve to understand how clear the website is to the user
ie. consistency with apple products
ie. facebook makes sure their "like" button looks the same on all devices, new and old

styletile are like the planning part of project runway projects 
-swatches, color pallets, fonts, layouts, etc

feature list - photos, writing, examples from other webistes 

parelex - scrolling down one page instead of having different pages

save photos around 100-150 kB

stumbleupon = enrichment, education, and entertainment

create break points in html = media queries 
colly.com is a good example

css-tricks.com  - media queries for standard devices - put this at the end of your CSS and put it at the end of your CSS and change only a few things 

typography - san serifs are designed for webistes, serifs are more readable for print

add font face
put the file in a folder called "type"
src: url('type/sansation-regular.-webfont.eot');

in HTML add the stnadard tab (head title), in the CSS tab add the @import tab at the top of the CSS

px, ems and rems - call the font size in the body, and then specify ratios later with percentages

multiple CSS selectors - can reference two classes at once
ex.
class = "column_1 all"
this is two classes ^^^

.column_1, .column_2{ 
}

other responsive design examples - can shink the width of the website to see what it looks like on an iphone

11/13:
design:
design for your user and your content - what do you ultimately want your users to know about you?
javascript is what makes animations (ex. image slide show, fancy animated buttons)

		<h2> Summary </h2>
		<p>Dana Evernden is a <i>learner</i></p>
		<p>I once took a strengths finder test at work, and learning was my number one strength, and I couldn't agree with that assessment more. I love getting myself into new situations and seeing how I survive and grow, and in turn learn more about myself and the world around me. </p>
		<p>
		</p>
		<p>I grew up in the small town of Holliston Massachusetts, a suburb about 45 minutes southwest of Boston. I went to UMass Amherst and acquired a degree in Industial Engineering. I've worked for EnerNOC, an energy efficiency company, from the day I left college. I love the people, work environment, and the passion and energy there. My responsibilities have changed quite a bit since I secured a full time position alomst two years ago, and these days I focus less on my teams' responsibilities and more on building Excel VBA tools for other teams within the Operations department.

		In my spare time I have a myriad of weird hobbies. I enjoy playing the euphonium, dragon boating, drum corps. I also enjoy normal hobbies like drawing, cooking, rock climbing, running, and hanging out with my Little Sister from Big Sisters of Greater Boston. I like setting almost impossible goals and meeting them, and most of all, I like learning. I've tried out being a prep chef, shadowing in an elementary school classroom, backpacking through europe, taking an html class, and running a marathon in just the past 10 months. </p>
		<p> </p> I aspire to change the world one person at a time with some quotes from my favorite professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst - George N. Parks. He created this concept called "starred thoughts" and has been preaching his ideas ever since.  <a href "http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/starred-thought">Here</a> is a tumblr that a student made filled with his ideas: </p>
